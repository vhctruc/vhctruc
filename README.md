## Hi, I'm Truc Vo

Data Engineer specializing in large-scale data pipelines, geospatial analytics, and backend systems.
I design and operate data infrastructure where accuracy, performance, and traceability are non-negotiable.

My work focuses on turning raw, fragmented spatial data into reliable analytical assets used for
decision-making, monitoring, and planning.

## Engineering Principles

- Data pipelines should be explainable, not mysterious
- Performance problems are design problems
- Spatial data deserves the same engineering discipline as any other system
- Clean data beats clever hacks every time
